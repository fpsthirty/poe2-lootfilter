# poe2-lootfilter

*based on NeverSink's lootfilter v0.1.1 and augmented with a few hundred of my additional rules*

## Basic principles of this project:
1. üíØ <ins>Pick everything you see on the ground, on any area level</ins>. At AreaLevel *1+ / 65+ / 71+ / 75+* you see fewer and fewer items that have str- & dex-requirements on them and other useless items for your class. <br> **Characters of level 90+**: check out the "Endgame custom rules" section to apply additional rules for hiding potentially excessive items.
2. üñãÔ∏è <ins>Minimalism for equipment styles</ins>: ~99% of the equipment is garbage that doesn't deserve much custom styling, but you'll see a colorful üé® design of currency, map-specific items etc.
Special equipment stylization applies in four cases:
   - for the best bases of the corresponding slot, on which the maximum affix tier *(itemLevel 81‚Äì82)* can be generated;
   - for some infrequent items on low-level characters: jewelry, belts, and Chiming staff;
   - items with additional quality *(caster weapons and armors only)*;
   - bases for crafting uniques with Chance Orb.
3. üìñ <ins>Ultimate documentation</ins>: in just a couple minutes you can familiarize yourself with the styles of ~95% of the items in the game and ~95% of the rules for showing/hiding items - there are over a dozen screenshots of how lootfilter works at the end of the article. If you're only interested in individual rules/styles, you can find them in the table of contents (look at the beginning of the lootfilter file)


More details are listed inside the `.lootfilter`-file.<br>
For now, I've only created one version of lootfilter ‚Äî üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **for caster classes**.<br>
*Note*: is not for a specific caster class, but **for the gameplay style** of your chosen class üßîüßùüêª

## INSTALLATION / UPDATE:

### ‚òÅÔ∏è CLOUD FILE
*Recommended for characters at levels 1-90.*<br>
Automatically updated lootfilter without the need to download any files.

üßæ **Instruction:**
1. Log in to the official website: https://www.pathofexile.com/
2. Open the page with list of lootfilters from the author of this repository: [fpsthirty-6961/item-filters](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/fpsthirty-6961/item-filters)
3. Click on the "Follow" button in lootfilter you're interested in. Now there are two variants of lootfilters:
   - for casters (wands and focuses are always shown)
   - for summoners (scepters and int-shields are always shown)
4. Turn on filter in the game settings : `Escape` -> Options -> Game -> select the filter from the Dropdown box of "Item Filter" section ‚Äî name of lootfilter will be **blue** color.

  ![settings/game-itemfilter](https://github.com/fpsthirty/poe2-lootfilter/raw/master/img/settings/game-itemfilter.png)


### üóÑÔ∏è LOCAL FILE
*Recommended for characters at levels 90+.*<br>
In this case you can make your own edits, including activating additionally prepared rules in the üìã "[[0700]] Endgame custom rules" section.

üßæ **Instruction:**
1. Open link of current release: [releases/latest](https://github.com/fpsthirty/poe2-lootfilter/releases/latest)
2. Scroll down to the "Assets"-section and click on the file name `NvrSnk+fps30_caster.filter` to download it.
3. Paste this file into the following folder: `%userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2` *(you can paste this correct link into File Explorer)*
4. Turn on filter in the game settings : `Escape` -> Options -> Game -> select the filter from the Dropdown box of "Item Filter" section ‚Äî name of lootfilter will be **white** color.

> [!WARNING]  
> Summoner settings are enabled by default; if you are playing as a caster without a large number of summons, open lootfilter-file in any text editor (I recommend Sublime Text), find "[[0200]] Section for non-summoner casters" section outside the table of contents.

## üìñ Documentation
*click on the last dropdown item first, you'll be more comfortable, trust me.*
