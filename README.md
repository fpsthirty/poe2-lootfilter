# poe2-lootfilter

*based on NeverSink's lootfilter v0.1.1 and augmented with a few hundred of my additional rules*

## Basic principles of this lootfilter:
1. <ins>Take everything you see on the ground</ins>. At AreaLevel *1+ / 65+ / 71+* you see fewer and fewer items that have str- & dex-requirements on them and other useless items for your class.
2. <ins>Minimalism for equipment</ins>: ~99% of the equipment is garbage that doesn't deserve much custom styling, but you'll see a colorful design of map-specific items etc.
Special equipment stylization applies in three cases: 
   - for the best bases of the corresponding slot, on which the maximum affix tier *(81–82 itemLevel)* can be generated;
   - for some infrequent items on low-level characters: jewelry, belts, and Chiming staff;
   - items with additional quality.


More details are listed inside the `.lootfilter`-file.<br>
For now, I've only created one version of lootfilter — **for caster classes**.<br> 
*Note*: is not for a specific caster class, but **for the gameplay style** of your chosen class.

## INSTALLATION / UPDATE:

1) Paste this file into the following folder: `%userprofile%/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2`
2) INGAME: `Escape` -> Options -> UI -> Scroll down -> Select the filter from the Dropdown box
